SLIP DAYS
---------
One slip day was used for this project.


NOTES
-----
Everything seems to work, although I belive there might be an issue with race
conditions when writing to the file. That is, if we're receiving data from the
shell and at the same time data is being written to the shell, the order in
which that data is logged to the log file is not deterministic. It depends on
which thread gets scheduled to run, so information could possibly be out of
order.

For a shell application though, this race condition shouldn't matter much since
a command is sent followed by a newline to the shell, and then data comes from
the shell to the user all at once. Generally, there shouldn't be an overlap that
could cause a race condition.

Since the client deals with writing to the log file this problem is specific to
the client. Both programs may suffer from an error arising when the exit routine
is called twice for some reason.

Also, the server does not accept more than one client. The spec didn't say
anything about support for more than one client.


FILES
-----
server.c - the source code used to build the server application which waits for
           the client to connect and sends the client's commands to the shell
client.c - source code used to build the client application which connects to
           the server and sends it commands from the user's terminal
Makefile - used to build the server and client programs.
           make client - builds the client
           make server - builds the server
           make        - builds both the client and server
my.key   - a key used by the server and client for encrypted communcations over
           the TCP socket.


TESTING
-------
Went throught the rubric and made sure that the processes exited correctly, that
the log file functioned correctly, and that the encrypt option functioned
correctly.
