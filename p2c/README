2C.1A
	Explain the change in performance of the synchronized methods as a function
	of the number of threads per list.
2C.1B
	Explain why threads per list is a more interesting number than threads (for
	this particular measurement)


2C.2A
	Compare the time per operation when increasing the lists value. Explain your
	observations.
2C.2B
	Compare the time per operation between mutex and spinlock. Explain your
	observations.


2C.3A
	Why must the mutex be held when pthread_cond_wait is called?
2C.3B
	Why must the mutex be released when the waiting thread is blocked?
2C.3C
	Why must the mutex be reacquired when the calling thread resumes?
2C.3D
	Why must mutex release be done inside of pthread_cond_wait? Why can't the
	caller simply release the mutex before calling pthread_cond_wait?
2C.3E
	Can pthread_cond_wait be implemented in user mode? If so, how? If it can
	only be implemented by a system call, explain why?
