Command to run program:

./lab3b directory // where directory is the directory containing the 6 csv files

alternatively, use:

python3 lab3b directory // where directory is the directory containing the 6 csv
                        // files
or even this:

make run

Description of included files:

1. lab3b - This is a Python 3 program that takes an argument to the directory
containing the six csv files needed.  If it doesn't get an argument then
it will assume that the six csv files are in the current directory.  It runs
through all six files and outputs any errors that it finds.  These errors
are of the types:

    1. unallocated block
    2. duplicately allocated block
    3. unallocated inode
    4. missing inode
    5. incorrect link count
    6. incorrect directory entry
    7. invalid block pointer

In this sense, one can say that our program kind of functions like a primitive
version of fsck.  It outputs these errors to a file named "lab3b_check.txt".

2. Makefile - This file has 3 important options:

    1. run - this is an automated command that will run the program on the
    current working directory
    2. clean - this does nothing because python is an interpreted language
    3. dist - this packs up the README, MAKEFILE, and lab3b into a tar.gz file

3. README - this file is the one you're reading right now.  It contains
information regarding the description of the included files, the student names/
ids, and a list of references used during the project.
